                        <p> Chinese coast guard ships and a Chinese navy helicopter harassed a group of Philippine fisheries vessels conducting a scientific survey in a hotly disputed area of the South China Sea, forcing them to cancel the operation, the Philippine coast guard said Saturday. <br><br>
                            Beijing has repeatedly asserted sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and accused rival claimant states, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia of encroachment. China has demarcated its territorial claims with a 10 dashed-line printed on maps but has not provided the exact coordinates.

                            The incident took place Friday near Sandy Cay, three small uninhabited sandbars flanked by an artificial island base of Chinese forces and a Philippines-occupied island in the Spratlys archipelago, the coast guard said.
                            
                            The Chinese coast guard ships approached two larger vessels, which maneuvered to avoid a collision, and a navy helicopter flew low over two smaller boats deployed by the ships, forcing the survey to be called off.
                            
                            A Chinese coast guard statement said that it drove the Philippine ships away after they entered the waters without China’s permission and attempted to land on the cay — which is called Tiexian Reef in Chinese — and conduct sand sampling.</p>

                            <h1 style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 45px; margin: 0px;"> Marcos grants clemency to ex-Iloilo mayor Jed Mabilog</h1>
                        </a>
                        <p>
                            The Palace confirmed Monday, January 27, that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has granted executive clemency to former Iloilo City Mayor Jed Mabilog, who was accused by former President Rodrigo Duterte of involvement in the illegal drug trade.
                            Asked about the clemency, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin simply responded, "Yes," in a Viber message to reporters.
                            “That’s true,” Bersamin confirmed. <br><br>
                            In a formal statement released later, Bersamin said that “the president granted Mabilog's petition for executive clemency in connection with his administrative case, thereby removing the penalties or disabilities resulting from such case.”
                            In a Facebook post, Mabilog’s legal counsel, Jeric Jucaban, thanked Marcos.
                            “A heartfelt thank you to President Bongbong Marcos for granting clemency to former Mayor Jed Mabilog. This incredible news represents not only a new chapter for Mayor Mabilog and his family but also validation for those who believed in justice and second chances,” Jucaban said. 
                            Attached to the post was the resolution for Mabilog’s petition for clemency.
                            The document detailed former Duterte’s accusation against Mabilog, followed by the Ombudsman’s order for his dismissal after he was found guilty of Serious Dishonesty for failing to explain an P8.9 million increase in his wealth.
                            <br><br>
                            “In view of Mabilog’s long-standing commitment to good governance, coupled with the awards and recognition received by Iloilo under his leadership, his Office finds the grant of the Petition warranted. Wherefore, premises considered, the instant Petition for executive clemency and removal of administrative penalties for disabilities filed by Jed Patrick E. Mabilog is hereby granted,” the document said. 

                            The document, dated Jan. 15, 2025, was signed by Bersamin himself.

                            When asked to confirm the documents posted by Jucaban, Bersamin confirmed their legitimacy.

                            Reporters have requested the full official document from the Palace, which Bersamin said will be released later.

                        </a>
                        <p>
                            A construction worker held his one-year-old daughter hostage along C-6 Road in Barangay Sta. Ana in Taytay, Rizal on Saturday evening.
                            Col. Felipe Maraggun, Rizal police provincial director, said the man, identified only as Marvin, took his daughter Lady Natalie and held a karambit knife to her neck.
                            He added that Marvin might have panicked upon seeing barangay officials heading to his house after his wife filed a complaint for the rape of his stepdaughter.                 
                            <br><br>
                            The incident was live-streamed on Facebook, drew a crowd and caused traffic congestion in the area.                        
                            Taytay Mayor Allan Martine De Leon and Maraggun negotiated for the child’s release, which Marvin did after an hour.                         
                            Charges for serious illegal detention, alarm and scandal and illegal possession of a deadly weapon were filed against Marvin.
